# ElderCare


**Elder Care** is a mobile application designed to support nurses and caregivers in managing and monitoring the nutrition routines of elderly patients with eating difficulties.  
The goal of this app is to **remind patients about their meals**, help nurses **track meal completion**, and improve the overall quality of elderly care.

## 🩺 Purpose
Elder Care helps healthcare professionals efficiently manage patient meal plans and monitor nutritional health.  
Nurses can:
- Create personalized **meal plans** for each patient.  
- **Monitor** whether patients have eaten their meals.  
- Receive **notifications** if a patient misses three consecutive meals.  
- **Register new patients** and manage their profiles.  
- **Scan patient QR codes** to quickly add them to their list and access personal information.

Patients can:

This ensures a clear communication flow between patients and nurses, helping reduce the risk of undernourishment and missed meals.
